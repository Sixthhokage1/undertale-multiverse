# Undertale Multiverse

## What is this?
The short, boring version: Undertale SAVEs under version control.

What makes it (hopefully) interesting is that as the title implies, it's an experiment with creating a multiverse of SAVEs by using git branches for every timeline branch.

The document initially describing my idea for this can be seen in [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/Sixthhokage1/b283e3d0688d125e22cc0bc65befa5b3).

## Why?
* I haven't played around with the branched endings yet other than Pacifist and Genocide
* It's thematically appropriate
* It gets me playing around with git
* Other SAVE repos I've seen are relatively linear.

## Project structure
>People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually* from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff.

Doctor Who jokes aside, there's definitely going to be a method to this madness. For starters, no SAVE files are going on the master branch, only project documentation (write-ups on the different timelines may or may not turn into fanfic). The first timeline will be dubbed Universe A (hey, it worked for Homestuck!) and I'll work from there.
